Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================
The script "run_analysis.R" in this repository reads the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Datasets 
and reshapes these into a tidy dataset.

Prerequisites:
- the UCI HAR Datasets (inclusing subdirectories) need to be in your working directoy
- the packages dplyr needs to be installed (it is loaded via a library command in the code)
